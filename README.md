# BlueMixProject


SmartCards started as a project during the HackingEDU hackathon. The original source from that project is available [here](https://github.com/brianspiering/hacking_edu).

This project attempts to extend and improve upon that original application by leveraging Bluemix Concept Insights. This work was done as part of a project our GalvanizeU Watson class.
