      "In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras' theorem, is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and c, often called the \"Pythagorean equation\":\n",

They are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but n-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound.\n",

The new triangle ACH is similar to triangle ABC, because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at A, meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as θ in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle CBH is also similar to ABC. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the Triangle postulate: the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the parallel postulate. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:\n",

A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be congruent, proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let A, B, C be the vertices of a right triangle, with a right angle at A. Drop a perpendicular from A to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.\n",

      "# The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.\n",

      "# The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).\n",

      "Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.\n",

      "#Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.\n",
      "#On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate.\n",

The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below, which consists of a large square, side , containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares a2 and b2 uncovered, the second of which leaves square c2 uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore\n",
      "\n",
      "A second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area c2, from four identical right triangles with sides a, b and c, fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas a2 and b2, which must have the same area as the initial large square.\n",

The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two.

In this case, two sequential line segments exist in parallel to a third line segment.  Because lines are one-dimensional, the coordinate subspaces onto which they are projected must also be one-dimensional.  Thus, projections appear on the coordinate axes rather than on the coordinate planes.  The lengths of the projected line segments on a given axis are summed, then squared, then added to the total lengths squared on the other axes.

Projections of the set are shown in green on the coordinate plane subspaces.  Objects shown initially upright in the yz-plane are subsequently tilted in parallel.  Again, regardless of set orientation, the result remains the same.  On each coordinate plane subspace, the areas of object projections are calculated individually (to avoid miscalculations due to projection overlap), then added together to produce the total projection area of the set on that plane.

      "Plimpton 322.jpg|thumb|The Plimpton 322 tablet records Pythagorean triples from Babylonian times.\n",
      "There is debate whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once, or many times in many places, and the date of first discovery is uncertain, as is the date of the first proof.  According to Joran Friberg, a historian of mathematics, evidence indicates that the Pythagorean Theorem was well-known to the mathematicians of the First Babylonian Dynasty (20th to 16th centuries BC), which would have been over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born. Other sources, such as a book by Leon Lederman and Dick Teresi, mention that Pythagorus discovered the theorem, although Teresi subsequently stated that the Babylonians developed the theorem \"at least fifteen hundred years before Pythagoras was \n",
      "born.\" The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of Pythagorean triples, knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartel Leendert van der Waerden (1903–1996) conjectured that Pythagorean triples were discovered algebraically by the Babylonians. Written between 2000 and 1786 BC, the Middle Kingdom Egyptian Berlin Papyrus 6619 includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The Mesopotamian tablet Plimpton 322, written between 1790 and 1750 BC during the reign of Hammurabi the Great, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples.\n",
      "\n",
      "In India, the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra, the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 2nd century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, and a geometrical proof of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle.\n",
      "The Apastamba Sulba Sutra (c. 600 BC) contains a numerical proof of the general Pythagorean theorem, using an area computation. Van der Waerden believed that \"it was certainly based on earlier traditions\". Boyer (1991) thinks the elements found in the Śulba-sũtram may be of Mesopotamian derivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "With contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC, the Chinese text Zhou Bi Suan Jing (周髀算经), (The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven) gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle—in China it is called the \"Gougu Theorem\" (勾股定理). During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), Pythagorean triples appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, together with a mention of right triangles. Some believe the theorem arose first in China, where it is alternatively known as the \"Shang Gao Theorem\" (商高定理), named after the Duke of Zhou's astronomer and mathematician, whose reasoning composed most of what was in the Zhou Bi Suan Jing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pythagoras, whose dates are commonly given as 569–475 BC, used algebraic methods to construct Pythagorean triples, according to Proclus's commentary on Euclid. Proclus, however, wrote between 410 and 485 AD. According to Thomas L. Heath (1861–1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived. However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted. \"Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally, [...] one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 400 BC, according to Proclus, Plato gave a method for finding Pythagorean triples that combined algebra and geometry. Around 300 BC, in Euclid's Elements, the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented.\n",

      "* A verse of the Major-General's Song in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera The Pirates of Penzance, \"About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news, With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse\", makes an oblique reference to the theorem.\n",
      "* The Scarecrow in the film The Wizard of Oz makes a more specific reference to the theorem. Upon receiving his diploma from the Wizard, he immediately exhibits his \"knowledge\" by reciting a mangled and incorrect version of the theorem: \"The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh, joy! Oh, rapture! I've got a brain!\"\n",
      "* In 2000, Uganda released a coin with the shape of an isosceles right triangle. The coin's tail has an image of Pythagoras and the equation α2 + β2 = γ2, accompanied with the mention \"PYTHAGORAS MILLENNIUM\".\n",
      "* Greece, Japan, San Marino, Sierra Leone, and Suriname have issued postage stamps depicting Pythagoras and the Pythagorean theorem.\n",

       "   'data': 'Trigonometry (from Greek trig\\xc5\\x8dnon, \"triangle\" and metron, \"measure\") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles.  The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.\\n\\nThe 3rd-century astronomers first noted that the lengths of the sides of a right-angle triangle and the angles between those sides have fixed relationships: that is, if at least the length of one side and the value of one angle is known, then all other angles and lengths can be determined algorithmically. These calculations soon came to be defined as the trigonometric functions and today are pervasive in both pure and applied mathematics: fundamental methods of analysis such as the Fourier transform, for example, or the wave equation, use trigonometric functions to understand cyclical phenomena across many applications in fields as diverse as physics, mechanical and electrical engineering, music and acoustics, astronomy, ecology, and biology.  Trigonometry is also the foundation of surveying.\\n\\nTrigonometry is most simply associated with planar right-angle triangles (each of which is a two-dimensional triangle with one angle equal to 90 degrees). The applicability to non-right-angle triangles exists, but, since any non-right-angle triangle (on a flat plane) can be bisected to create two right-angle triangles, most problems can be reduced to calculations on right-angle triangles. Thus the majority of applications relate to right-angle triangles.  One exception to this is spherical trigonometry, the study of triangles on spheres, surfaces of constant positive curvature, in elliptic geometry (a fundamental part of astronomy and navigation). Trigonometry on surfaces of negative curvature is part of hyperbolic geometry.\\n\\nTrigonometry basics are often taught in schools, either as a separate course or as a part of a precalculus course.\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nSumerian astronomers studied angle measure, using a division of circles into 360 degrees. They, and later the Babylonians, studied the ratios of the sides of similar triangles and discovered some properties of these ratios but did not turn that into a systematic method for finding sides and angles of triangles. The ancient Nubians used a similar method.\\n\\nIn the 3rd century BC, Hellenistic Greek mathematicians such as Euclid (from Alexandria, Egypt) and Archimedes (from Syracuse, Sicily) studied the properties of chords and inscribed angles in circles, and they proved theorems that are equivalent to modern trigonometric formulae, although they presented them geometrically rather than algebraically. In 140 BC Hipparchus (from Iznik, Turkey) gave the first tables of chords, analogous to modern tables of sine values, and used them to solve problems in trigonometry and spherical trigonometry. In the 2nd century AD the Greco-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy  (from Alexandria, Egypt) printed detailed trigonometric tables (Ptolemy\\'s table of chords) in Book 1, chapter 11 of his Almagest. Ptolemy used chord length to define his trigonometric functions, a minor difference from the sine convention we use today. (The value we call sin(\\xce\\xb8) can be found by looking up the chord length for twice the angle of interest (2\\xce\\xb8) in Ptolemy\\'s table, and then dividing that value by two.) Centuries passed before more detailed tables were produced, and Ptolemy\\'s treatise remained in use for performing trigonometric calculations in astronomy throughout the next 1200 years in the medieval Byzantine, Islamic, and, later, Western European worlds.\\n\\nThe modern sine convention is first attested in the Surya Siddhanta, and its properties were further documented by the 5th century (AD) Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata. These Greek and Indian works were translated and expanded by medieval Islamic mathematicians. By the 10th century, Islamic mathematicians were using all six trigonometric functions, had tabulated their values, and were applying them to problems in spherical geometry. At about the same time, Chinese mathematicians developed trigonometry independently, although it was not a major field of study for them. Knowledge of trigonometric functions and methods reached Western Europe via Latin translations of Ptolemy\\'s Greek Almagest as well as the works of Persian and Arabic astronomers such as Al Battani and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. One of the earliest works on trigonometry by a northern European mathematician is De Triangulis by the 15th century German mathematician Regiomontanus, who was encouraged to write, and provided with a copy of the Almagest, by the Byzantine Greek scholar cardinal Basilios Bessarion with whom he lived for several years. At the same time another translation of the Almagest from Greek into Latin was completed by the Cretan George of Trebizond. Trigonometry was still so little known in 16th-century northern Europe that Nicolaus Copernicus devoted two chapters of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium to explain its basic concepts.\\n\\nDriven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large geographic areas, trigonometry grew into a major branch of mathematics.  Bartholomaeus Pitiscus was the first to use the word, publishing his Trigonometria in 1595. Gemma Frisius described for the first time the method of triangulation still used today in surveying.  It was Leonhard Euler who fully incorporated complex numbers into trigonometry. The works of the Scottish mathematicians James Gregory in the 17th century and Colin Maclaurin in the 18th century were influential in the development of trigonometric series. Also in the 18th century, Brook Taylor defined the general Taylor series.\\n\\n== Overview ==\\n\\nIf one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees and one of the other angles is known, the third is thereby fixed, because the three angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees. The two acute angles therefore add up to 90 degrees: they are complementary angles. The shape of a triangle is completely determined, except for similarity, by the angles. Once the angles are known, the ratios of the sides are determined, regardless of the overall size of the triangle. If the length of one of the sides is known, the other two are determined. These ratios are given by the following trigonometric functions of the known angle A, where a,  b and c refer to the lengths of the sides in the accompanying figure:\\n\\n*Sine function (sin), defined as the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.\\n:: \\\\sin A=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{opposite}}{\\\\textrm{hypotenuse}}=\\\\frac{a}{\\\\,c\\\\,}\\\\,.\\n*Cosine function (cos), defined as the ratio of the adjacent leg to the hypotenuse.\\n:: \\\\cos A=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\\\textrm{hypotenuse}}=\\\\frac{b}{\\\\,c\\\\,}\\\\,.\\n*Tangent function (tan), defined as the ratio of the opposite leg to the adjacent leg.\\n:: \\\\tan A=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{opposite}}{\\\\textrm{adjacent}}=\\\\frac{a}{\\\\,b\\\\,}=\\\\frac{a}{\\\\,c\\\\,}*\\\\frac{c}{\\\\,b\\\\,}=\\\\frac{a}{\\\\,c\\\\,} / \\\\frac{b}{\\\\,c\\\\,}=\\\\frac{\\\\sin A}{\\\\cos A}\\\\,.\\n\\nThe hypotenuse is the side opposite to the 90 degree angle in a right triangle; it is the longest side of the triangle and one of the two sides adjacent to angle A. The adjacent leg is the other side that is adjacent to angle A. The opposite side is the side that is opposite to angle A. The terms perpendicular and base are sometimes used for the opposite and adjacent sides respectively. Many people find it easy to remember what sides of the right triangle are equal to sine, cosine, or tangent, by memorizing the word SOH-CAH-TOA (see below under Mnemonics).\\n\\nThe reciprocals of these functions are named the cosecant (csc or cosec), secant (sec), and cotangent (cot), respectively:\\n:\\\\csc A=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin A}=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{hypotenuse}}{\\\\textrm{opposite}}=\\\\frac{c}{a} ,\\n\\n:\\\\sec A=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos A}=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{hypotenuse}}{\\\\textrm{adjacent}}=\\\\frac{c}{b} ,\\n\\n:\\\\cot A=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tan A}=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\\\textrm{opposite}}=\\\\frac{\\\\cos A}{\\\\sin A}=\\\\frac{b}{a} .\\n\\nThe inverse functions are called the arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent, respectively. There are arithmetic relations between these functions, which are known as trigonometric identities. The cosine, cotangent, and cosecant are so named because they are respectively the sine, tangent, and secant of the complementary angle abbreviated to \"co-\".\\n\\nWith these functions one can answer virtually all questions about arbitrary triangles by using the law of sines and the law of cosines. These laws can be used to compute the remaining angles and sides of any triangle as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since every polygon may be described as a finite combination of triangles.\\n\\n===Extending the definitions===\\n\\nThe above definitions only apply to angles between 0 and 90 degrees (0 and \\xcf\\x80/2 radians). Using the unit circle, one can extend them to all positive and negative arguments (see trigonometric function). The trigonometric functions are periodic, with a period of 360 degrees or 2\\xcf\\x80 radians. That means their values repeat at those intervals. The tangent and cotangent functions also have a shorter period, of 180 degrees or \\xcf\\x80 radians.\\n\\nThe trigonometric functions can be defined in other ways besides the geometrical definitions above, using tools from calculus and infinite series. With these definitions the trigonometric functions can be defined for complex numbers. The complex exponential function is particularly useful.\\n\\n: e^{x+iy} = e^x(\\\\cos  y + i \\\\sin  y).\\n\\nSee Euler\\'s and De Moivre\\'s formulas.\\n\\nImage:Sine curve drawing animation.gif|Graphing process of y = sin(x) using a unit circle.\\nImage:csc drawing process.gif|Graphing process of y = csc(x), the reciprocal of sine, using a unit circle.\\nImage:tan drawing process.gif|Graphing process of y = tan(x) using a unit circle.\\n\\n===Mnemonics===\\n\\\\u003c!--------\\n  Please note: The one mnemonic already provided is enough. DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN MNEMONICS, especially ridiculous ones such as \"Sex on holidays Comes after having Tons of alcohol\", etcetera. Such edits DO NOT improve the article but add obfuscation and, in some cases, constitute subversive vandalism. They WILL be reverted.\\n ---------\\\\u003e\\n\\nA common use of mnemonics is to remember facts and relationships in trigonometry. For example, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them and their corresponding sides as strings of letters. For instance, a mnemonic is SOH-CAH-TOA:\\n\\n:Sine = Opposite \\xc3\\xb7 Hypotenuse\\n:Cosine = Adjacent \\xc3\\xb7 Hypotenuse\\n:Tangent = Opposite \\xc3\\xb7 Adjacent\\n\\nOne way to remember the letters is to sound them out phonetically (i.e., SOH-CAH-TOA, which is pronounced \\'so-k\\xc9\\x99-toe-uh\\'  ). Another method is to expand the letters into a sentence, such as \"Some Old Hippie Caught Another Hippie Trippin\\' On Acid\".\\n\\n===Calculating trigonometric functions===\\n\\nTrigonometric functions were among the earliest uses for mathematical tables. Such tables were incorporated into mathematics textbooks and students were taught to look up values and how to interpolate between the values listed to get higher accuracy. Slide rules had special scales for trigonometric functions.\\n\\nToday scientific calculators have buttons for calculating the main trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, and sometimes cis and their inverses). Most allow a choice of angle measurement methods: degrees, radians, and sometimes gradians. Most computer programming languages provide function libraries that include the trigonometric functions. The floating point unit hardware incorporated into the microprocessor chips used in most personal computers has built-in instructions for calculating trigonometric functions.\\n\\n== Applications of trigonometry ==\\n\\nThere is an enormous number of uses of trigonometry and trigonometric functions. For instance, the technique of triangulation is used in astronomy to measure the distance to nearby stars, in geography to measure distances between landmarks, and in satellite navigation systems. The sine and cosine functions are fundamental to the theory of periodic functions such as those that describe sound and light waves.\\n\\nFields that use trigonometry or trigonometric functions include astronomy (especially for locating apparent positions of celestial objects, in which spherical trigonometry is essential) and hence navigation (on the oceans, in aircraft, and in space), music theory, audio synthesis, acoustics, optics, electronics, biology, medical imaging (CAT scans and ultrasound), pharmacy, chemistry, number theory (and hence cryptology), seismology, meteorology, oceanography, many physical sciences, land surveying and geodesy, architecture, image compression, phonetics, economics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer graphics, cartography, crystallography and game development.\\n\\n== Pythagorean identities ==\\n\\nIdentities are those equations that hold true for any value.\\n\\n:\\\\sin^2 A + \\\\cos^2 A = 1 \\\\\\n\\n(The following two can be derived from the first.)\\n\\n:\\\\sec^2 A - \\\\tan^2 A = 1 \\\\\\n\\n:\\\\csc^2 A - \\\\cot^2 A = 1 \\\\\\n\\n== Angle transformation formulae ==\\n\\n:\\\\sin (A \\\\pm B) = \\\\sin A \\\\ \\\\cos B \\\\pm \\\\cos A \\\\ \\\\sin B\\n\\n:\\\\cos (A \\\\pm B) = \\\\cos A \\\\ \\\\cos B \\\\mp \\\\sin A \\\\ \\\\sin B\\n\\n:\\\\tan (A \\\\pm B) = \\\\frac{ \\\\tan A \\\\pm \\\\tan B }{ 1 \\\\mp \\\\tan A  \\\\ \\\\tan B}\\n\\n:\\\\cot (A \\\\pm B) = \\\\frac{ \\\\cot A \\\\ \\\\cot B \\\\mp 1}{ \\\\cot B \\\\pm \\\\cot A }\\n\\n== Common formulae ==\\n\\nCertain equations involving trigonometric functions are true for all angles and are known as trigonometric identities. Some identities equate an expression to a different expression involving the same angles. These are listed in List of trigonometric identities. Triangle identities that relate the sides and angles of a given triangle are listed below.\\n\\nIn the following identities, A, B and C are the angles of a triangle and a, b and c are the lengths of sides of the triangle opposite the respective angles (as shown in the diagram).\\n\\n===Law of sines===\\nThe law of sines (also known as the \"sine rule\") for an arbitrary triangle states:\\n\\n:\\\\frac{a}{\\\\sin A} = \\\\frac{b}{\\\\sin B} = \\\\frac{c}{\\\\sin C} = 2R = \\\\frac{abc}{2\\\\Delta},\\nwhere \\\\Delta is the area of the triangle and R is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the triangle:\\n\\n:R = \\\\frac{abc}{\\\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)(b+c-a)}}.\\n\\nAnother law involving sines can be used to calculate the area of a triangle. Given two sides a and b and the angle between the sides C, the area of the triangle is given by half the product of the lengths of two sides and the sine of the angle between the two sides:\\n\\n:\\\\mbox{Area} = \\\\Delta = \\\\frac{1}{2}a b\\\\sin C.\\n\\n===Law of cosines===\\nThe law of cosines (known as the cosine formula, or the \"cos rule\") is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem to arbitrary triangles:\\n\\n:c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\\\\cos C ,\\\\,\\n\\nor equivalently:\\n\\n:\\\\cos C=\\\\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}.\\\\,\\n\\nThe law of cosines may be used to prove Heron\\'s formula, which is another method that may be used to calculate the area of a triangle. This formula states that if a triangle has sides of lengths a, b, and c, and if the semiperimeter is\\n\\n:s=\\\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c),\\n\\nthen the area of the triangle is:\\n\\n:\\\\mbox{Area} = \\\\Delta = \\\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\\\frac{abc}{4R}, \\nwhere R is the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle.\\n\\n===Law of tangents===\\nThe law of tangents:\\n\\n:\\\\frac{a-b}{a+b}=\\\\frac{\\\\tan\\\\left[\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(A-B)\\\\right]}{\\\\tan\\\\left[\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(A+B)\\\\right]}\\n\\n===Euler\\'s formula===\\nEuler\\'s formula, which states that e^{ix} = \\\\cos x + i \\\\sin x, produces the following analytical identities for sine, cosine, and tangent in terms of e and the imaginary unit i:\\n:\\\\sin x = \\\\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}, \\\\qquad \\\\cos x = \\\\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}, \\\\qquad \\\\tan x = \\\\frac{i(e^{-ix} - e^{ix})}{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}.\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n* Aryabhata\\'s sine table\\n* Generalized trigonometry \\n* L\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa1rt sphere\\n* List of triangle topics\\n* List of trigonometric identities\\n* Rational trigonometry\\n* Skinny triangle\\n* Small-angle approximation\\n* Trigonometric functions\\n* Trigonometry in Galois fields\\n* Unit circle\\n* Uses of trigonometry\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n==Bibliography==\\n\\n*Christopher M.
